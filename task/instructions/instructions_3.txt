While you are listening to the vowels please 
remain as still as possible, as movements
(even slight head movements and eye blinks)
will interfere with the data you are providing.

If you have to move at any time during the experiment
please confine this activity to the beginning of each
trial when the fixation cross "+" is shown on the screen.

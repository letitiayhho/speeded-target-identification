males = 10, 17, 20

subj10 m1
subj17 m2

subj9 f1
subj15 f2

subject 19 EH sucks, deleted EH9.wav, confirmed by checking pitch

Based on the pitches and my measure of vowel space difference, speakers 22 and 24 should be similar, and 9 and 16 should be different. Their vowels are attached.

9- X
16- Y
22- A
24- B

match all lengths to 300 ms (longest approx 270 ms)
PSOLA works GREAT
don't need to zero pad wav file
match all rms to 0.25 (max is 0.2087)


change rms.....?
EE2 and EE3 for subj 22 sucks (originally EE.wav and EE4.wav)
IH3 for subj 22 sucks
OO3 for subj 22 sucks
UH3 for subj 22 is very different


remove EH6 from subj16/modified

subj9 actually sucks, gonna have to nix 

10/4/2021
removing vowels shorter than 100 msec to see if that helps
will now check vowel quality
will drop subjects with insufficient number of vowels

subj9 — 
AE
AH
EE— only good one
EH
IH— none left
OO- 3 left
UH - none left

subj10
male

subj15
AE
AH
EE
EH- only 1
IH- only 1
OO
UH - none left

subj16
plenty of all, none sound fantastic though

subj17
male

subj18
plenty of all, none sound fantastic though

subj19
AE
AH
EE
EH- only 1
IH- none
OO
UH- only 1

subj20
AE
AH
EE
EH
IH
OO
UH- only 2


22 sounds nice
23 sounds nice

A— EE1, EE2, EE3, EH1, IH3, OO1, OO3
B- EE1, EE3, EH1, EH3?, UH2??? CHECK LENGTH UH3?


after nixing subj9, it should be
15- X
16- Y
22/23- A
24- B

so let's check their vowels first (AH, EE, EH, OO)

wait what, not all durations were modified?
maybe we should not use EE, replace EE with IH (AH, EH, IH, OO)

15- X
16- Y
22- A
24- B

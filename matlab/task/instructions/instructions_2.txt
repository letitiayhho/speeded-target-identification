then played a series of vowels.
Press any button on the response box every time you hear
the target vowel.
An "x" symbol will appear on the screen while the vowels
are playing.
You will need to listen carefully to each vowel as they
will be presented quickly.
A "+" symbol will indicate the start of each new trial.

subject 19 EH sucks, deleted EH9.wav, confirmed by checking pitch

Based on the pitches and my measure of vowel space difference, speakers 22 and 24 should be similar, and 9 and 16 should be different. Their vowels are attached.

9- X
16- Y
22- A
24- B

match all lengths to 300 ms (longest approx 270 ms)
PSOLA works GREAT
don't need to zero pad wav file
match all rms to 0.25 (max is 0.2087)
